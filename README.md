## üìâ Problem Statement
Employee retention is one of the biggest challenges organizations face today. High employee turnover leads to significant operational inefficiencies, including:

- Increased recruitment and training costs.
- Loss of experienced professionals, impacting productivity.
- Disruptions in team dynamics and project continuity.

At Ai Robotics, Mr. Francis, a senior manager, noticed a rising turnover rate among employees. Many skilled professionals were resigning, and exit interviews revealed a common concern:
üí∞ Salary dissatisfaction and a lack of competitive compensation strategies.

Despite offering performance-based raises, the company lacked data-driven insights to determine the right salary adjustments. Without a structured approach to salary benchmarking, Ai Robotics risked further attrition, potentially affecting long-term business growth.

To address this, Mr. Francis sought the expertise of Mr. Andrew, a data scientist, to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting employee salaries based on market trends, skills, and experience.

## üí° Business Solution
To combat employee attrition and ensure competitive compensation, Ai Robotics decided to integrate predictive analytics into its HR decision-making process.

‚úÖ How does the solution work?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Processing:

- Gathering historical employee data (experience, job role, location, etc.).
- Incorporating external salary benchmarks for industry comparison.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Model Development:

- Training predictive models to forecast salaries based on various employee attributes.
- Using algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Implementation & Decision-Making:

- The HR team can adjust salary structures proactively to retain talent.
- Managers receive AI-powered insights to ensure competitive pay scales.

By leveraging machine learning, Ai Robotics aims to:
‚úÖ Optimize salary structures for enhanced employee satisfaction.
‚úÖ Reduce turnover rates by offering data-backed compensation.
‚úÖ Improve overall workforce stability, boosting productivity and retention.

This data-driven strategy aligns employee expectations with industry standards, strengthening the company‚Äôs position in a competitive talent market.

## üõ† Installation & Setup

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
- git clone https://github.com/AnupamKNN/EmployeeAttrition.git
- cd EmployeeAttrition

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies
- python3.10 -m venv venv
- source venv/bin/activate  # (Linux/macOS)
- venv\Scripts\activate  # (Windows)
- pip install -r requirements.txt

If you are using Conda Environment (Anaconda Navigator)
- conda create --name venv python=3.10 -y
- conda activate venv/
- pip install -r requirements.txt


### Explanation:
1. Creates a Conda virtual environment** named `venv` with Python 3.10.
2. Activates the environment.
3. Installs dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.  

This makes it easy for anyone cloning your repo to set up their environment correctly! ‚úÖ
